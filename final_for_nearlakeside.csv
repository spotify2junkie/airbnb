-Hebrews 13:2-

I am a fun and funny (yes, even though I am German....go figure!) person, who loves life and people.
 
My career in hotel business has provided hours of entertaining stories and experience... Growing up with two older sisters, I got stuck with their music - I love my Classic Rock and will see ""Rush"" anytime they play in my city. 

My German roots and my family over there are very important to me, as is my Catholic upbringing, but my love for THIS country rules, and I fulfilled a childhood dream by living here... 

I've lived in fabulous cities and made amazing friends along the way - I bet I have a story or two to share...

What else?! I've ran the Chicago Marathon in '11, motorcycled through Canada in '15, I like boxing and kayaking, bicycling and seriously hanging out on my couch with a good book or a great movie. 

I can also cook decently and love feeding and entertaining people, and I like heavy, dark wines and Macallan scotch. 
My husband and I like watching Netflix together and you are always welcome to join us.

We are also animal lovers and have 2 French Bulldogs. 

We have been hosting on Air BnB for over four years now.  The one thing we have learned is that each guest is different and has different expectations and needs.
