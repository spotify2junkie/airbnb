I met people from around the world and had such a great experience I decided to go ahead and do something similar. I love meeting new people and hope to make some friends along the way!
I am a Chicago native and love this city. I love the diversity of the neighborhoods, the history and that there is always something to do.
I'm an avid reader and always have two book going, one fiction, one non-fiction-depending on my mood.
I am currently involved in a torrid affair with my Netflix account but pull myself away to go for a nice walk around the neighborhood or to a local restaurant. My goal this year is to try every Chinese restaurant within a 3 mile radius-there are a lot!
I'm an accountant but currently taking a break for family. I actually kinda miss doing taxes believe it or not. I'm the kind of person that needs to have a project or to be striving towards a goal in order to be at my best so I always have something going on, even small projects bring me peace.
I love trying new restaurants and I also love to cook. Making up my own recipes with whatever random items I have in my fridge is always fun. It usually turns out pretty good too!
This is just a scratch of the surface and I hope that it gives you an idea as to who I am. I can't wait to meet you and here about your journey.

I'm serious.  Six months after my birth, I moved from the east coast to the west coast and then at the age of two I flew overseas and bounced around for a few years before coming back to the states. All of this was done before the age of five and that was only the beginning.  
You know that question you're always asked when trying to find your purpose in life.  When your counselor asks, ""If you had all the money in the world, what would you do?""  The answer.  I would travel.
Grant it, one unfortunately does need money for the most part to travel. So I've picked up a few other meaningful projects in my life, called jobs.  :) 
Overall, I'm a pretty easygoing host and traveler.  I've stayed in my share of hostels, B&Bs, and hotels.  So I look forward to future hosting and travel opportunities with Airbnb.  

I also have this pretty fabulous guy in my life now that likes to travel too and so we are both looking forward to hosting our place and welcome you to check it out!
